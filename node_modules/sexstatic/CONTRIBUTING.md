## Code of Conduct

This is a pretty small project and it hasn't been a problem yet. However, to
be clear: Everyone needs to be nice to each other. Sexist/racist/etc behavior
won't be tolerated.

Glad we cleared that up.
Everybody likes Sex.

## Branching / Fork It

Before working on your fix/feature/whatever, you should create a fork of
node-sexstatic. Pull requests might go over if you aren't a suckshit coder
but this is a fork of a fork so, take note.

## Code Style

Sexstatic's code base follows a relatively consistent style. The closer your
patch blends in with the status quo, the better.

A few PROTIPS off the top of my head:

1. Variables don't need to all be declared at the top, BUT variable *blocks*
should do the whole one-var, tons-of-commas thing.
2. Look at how spacing is done around conditionals and functions. Do it like
that.
3. `else`'s and similar should be on the line *after* the preceding bracket.

## Keep It Moving

I don't always notice new PRs, and sometimes I will forget to follow up on
them. If this happens to you, you can bump the PR thread or find me on
IRC or twitter.

## LAST RULE

HAVE FUN :v :v
